# Finance-Tracker
First project on web development, Finance Tracker named "SpendSense"
Inspiration:
What started as a simple school project soon revealed its real-world potential. As I developed SpendSense, I realized that this wasn’t just an academic requirement—it was an answer to a growing problem in today’s society. We live in a fast-paced digital world where financial discipline is constantly tested by endless temptations: food delivery apps, online shopping platforms, buy-now-pay-later schemes, and other countless spending triggers. Many people find themselves trapped in a cycle of impulsive spending—adding to cart before payday, accumulating debt, and living paycheck to paycheck.

SpendSense was created to disrupt that cycle. It’s more than just a budgeting app—it’s a financial awareness tool. By offering real-time tracking, behavioral insights, and smart spending alerts, SpendSense empowers users to make mindful financial decisions. It’s built to help people regain control, form healthier money habits, and spend with purpose—not pressure.
