# Finance-Tracker
first project on web development, Finance Tracker named "Spend Sense"
Inspiration:
This project was for a school project only but I realized that why not pursue it realtime, this may be have a potential? I created SpendSense after observing how today’s society struggles with smart financial habits. We live in a world constantly bombarded by digital temptations—food delivery apps, online shopping platforms, and buy-now-pay-later schemes. Many people are drowning in debt, with pending purchases in their carts even before their salaries are credited. It’s a cycle of impulsive spending driven by convenience and instant gratification. SpendSense was built to break that cycle—to empower users with mindful spending habits, real-time tracking, and personalized insights so they can take control of their finances instead of being controlled by them.
