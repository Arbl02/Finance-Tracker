# Finance-Tracker
first project on web development, Finance Tracker named "SpendSense"
Inspiration:
This project was suppose to be for a school project purposes only but I realized that why not pursue it realtime, this may have have a potential right? I created SpendSense after observing how today’s society struggles with smart financial habits. We live in a world constantly bombarded by digital temptations—food delivery apps, online shopping platforms, buy-now-pay-later schemes and other online spending platforms. Many people are drowning in debt, with pending purchases in their carts even before their salaries are credited. It’s a cycle of impulsive spending driven by convenience and instant gratification. SpendSense was built to break that cycle—to empower users with mindful spending habits, real-time tracking, and personalized insights so they can take control of their finances instead of being controlled by them.
